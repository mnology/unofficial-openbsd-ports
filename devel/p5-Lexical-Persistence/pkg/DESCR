Lexical::Persistence does a few things, all related. Note that all the
behaviors listed here are the defaults. Subclasses can override nearly
every aspect of Lexical::Persistence's behavior.

Lexical::Persistence lets your code access persistent data through
lexical variables. This example prints "some value" because the value of
$x perists in the $lp object between setter() and getter().

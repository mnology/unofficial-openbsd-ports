The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing
utilities. Various ways to say "ok" with better diagnostics, facilities
to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated data
structures. While you can do almost anything with a simple ok()
function, it doesn't provide good diagnostic output.
